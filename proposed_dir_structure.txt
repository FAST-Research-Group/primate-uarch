# put bad ideas here #

hw
  - templates: the main template and all supporting scala
  - BFUs: accelerators (scala)
  - sim: the top file and any supporting infra needed to simulate the hardware
sw: 
  - user primate code and bfu_list.txt
  (can also be located out of tree)
testing:
  - verilator test suites, automated testing scripts, etc
scripts:
  - all supporting buildflow scripts (build.sbt, scm.py, primate_assembler, etc)

call "make -f /priamte/primate-uarch/Makefile"

make archgen (run-archgen)
make hardware : depends on archgen (primate.cfg)
make compiler : depends on archgen
make compile : depends on compiler
make bitstream : depends on hardware
make sim : depends on compile and hardware
make wave : depoends on sim

seperate targets that dont build deps
