# put bad ideas here #

# there is too much stuff in apps. move all the scripts necessary for the build/test flow into its own directory

scripts         : where all the build/test flow scripts should live
hw              : where are the hardware scala/sv files should live
 - templates    : the main cpu core pipeline
 - BFUs         : where all custom BFUs should be
chisel          : some simulator stuff lives here. pull out the necessary stuff and nuke the rest
apps            : put software for various apps here (NO BUILD INFRA (ex scripts, build.sh))
